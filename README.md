- Your first task is to figure out what the Contract Creation Code is and ways to get it for any contract, verified or not.

- Then, you’ll begin on your second task, which you will be submitting. You will be writing some code in JavaScript (or TypeScript if you prefer) that finds the Contract Creation Code for an arbitrary address. Your code should involve making calls to a general Ethereum node, which implies that using packages which assume a specific node are forbidden (for example, the Alchemy SDK). You should also not be making calls to any specific data provider, so that your code works even on forked mainnets. However, with those rules you’re allowed to do almost whatever you want, as long as it gets the job done.
